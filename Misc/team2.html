<h2>Ethical Issues Related to Technology Automation-Personal Reflections and Recommendations </h2>

<p>When we use automation correctly, it can improve working life for our society, but when we approach it incorrectly, there will be some ethical issues.

  An ethical issue of automation is that it increases the unemployment rate. From my perspective, to overcome this problem, people can control the use of automation applied in the workforce at a level that would not affect human jobs too much. Automation should be used as a tool only to help us but not as a replacement. For example, people may only use automation in some conditions such as dangerous work environments to help increase worker safety or to reduce worker’s stressors. This would increase the total productivity and efficiency and also allow some more people to be able to get a job in the future.
  Another way to overcome this problem is to focus on some different skills. Although robots can work twenty-four hours for seven days, it is doubtful that they could be as creative and emotionally intelligent as human beings. Thus, skills that revolve around social relationships, responsibility, creativity, imagingation and leadership are likely to spring up. So people can focus more on these aspects and give up all the easy and boring daily tasks to the machine.
  
  Another ethical issue of automation is that it causes loss of human interaction. This is because people choose to do more things through the internet instead of having social interactions with each other. However, from my perspective, it is not the automation’s fault that caused this, because we are free to make our choice on whether to spend more time with our social circles or online. Machine automation is only something we have investigated and it is our choices to use it for benefiting our life or to slave ourselves. 
  
  In the conclusion, automation has occured for many years and it continuesly bring us benefit to our society. As there are some significant benefits such as increasing our productivity and efficiency, it seems that the benefit it brings us is far more than the downsides of it. The ethical issue of automation only occurs if we use it in an incorrect way. To reduce these ethical issues, we should treat automation as an assistant to help our society to become better but not as a replacement of ourselves.
