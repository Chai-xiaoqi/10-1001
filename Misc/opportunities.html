    <h4>Increase personal safety</h4>
    <p>Automation can be used to perform some dangerous physical tasks. This avoids workers from all the dangerous work procedures and thus reduces the risk of injury at the operation level. While automation is taking care of physical work, employees have more time to take care of projects that require higher-end thinking. This then allows the workers to come up with a better project as there is more time spent on it.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="column1">
    <h4>Reduce cost</h4>
    <p>Increase in safety leads to reduction in cost. According to the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration, businesses spend about $170 billion a year on injury and illness. By improving safety procedures, companies are able to save up to 40% of the costs and this can really be a great amount of money.  Automation also allows companies in the long term perspective, that although there may be a higher expense upfront, the cost of maintence is much lower than continuing to pay for current procudures.

    <h4>Reduce staff stressor </h4>
    <p> Compared to robots, humans easily experience stressors under huge workloads or after working for a long period. However, robotics do not have emotions so they are able to work continuesly for a really long period of time. By having automation, people can simply shift their work to the robot when they feel stressful because of the workloads, and the machine will continue their work for them. A statistic even showed that automation had a positive impact on staff experience of stressors, improving working conditions and workloads.” </p>
  </div>

  <div class="column1">
    <h4>Increase productivity & time saving</h4>
    <p>Automation improves employment productivity because as physical labor and risk of injuries are reduced, employees are able to take more sphisticated roles and spend more time on their tasks without the fears of being injured. While robotics and automated software do all the boring daily activities and time consuming tasks, workers can focus on strategy to take operations to the next level. According to a study, automation could raise productivity growth on a global basis by as much as 0.8 to 1.4 percent annually.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="column1">
    <h4>Increase efficiency</h4>
      <p>By reducing the cost of producing a subset of tasks, automation raises the demand for labor in nonautomated tasks (Acemoglu & Restrepo, 2018). In particular, automation leads to the substitution of capital for labor because at the margin, capital performs certain tasks more cheaply than labor used to. This reduces the prices of the goods and services whose production processes are being automated, making households effectively richer, and increasing the demand for all goods and services.
