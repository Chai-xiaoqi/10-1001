<h2>Ethical Issues Related to Technology Automation-Personal Reflections and Recommendations </h2>

<p>Technology automation is the creation and application of technologies to produce and deliver goods and services with minimal human intervention. It can help humans to improve work efficiency and productivity. But there are also some ethical issues in automated machines.</p>

<p>The most common and most concerning one is unemployment.  Because of the popularity of automation, many people lose many job opportunities. Companies like to improve product quality by introducing automated machines instead of hiring highly skilled employees. Especially in agriculture and manufacturing, a lot of repetitive and boring jobs are replaced by automated machines. 
</p>
<p>Another issue is wealth inequality, which is also related to unemployment. Most of the time, when doing some predictable repetitive tasks, machines are more efficient than humans, so most companies prefer to choose machines to work for them. If people want to earn a living, they need to lower their wage requirements, which will lead to a decline in their quality of life. At the same time, the company has gained more benefits. They can use the money to make more investments. The wages of employees are getting less and less, and the money of capitalists is getting more and more. This is a vicious circle.
</p>
<p>Loss of social interaction is also an important ethical issue in technological automation. Due to the development of automated machines, chat bots have also been increasingly used in social activities. People usually interact with machines. They prefer to get quick answers from chatbots instead of communicating directly with humans. After interacting with machines for a long time, some people will even suffer from social phobia, and therefore lose the most basic communication between humans.
</p>
<p>Although many people will be unemployed because of automated machines, at the same time, many new jobs will be created, which can improve the living standards of most people. We need to take advantage of these changes. We need to remember that automation is there to improve the work of your employees. It’s not the enemy, and it’s not a usurper. As long as automation is treated as an assistant and not a replacement, the ethical problems can be addressed. The correct use of automation can improve the working life of our team. It can provide team members with opportunities to seek further training and career development, and can eliminate tasks that make team members exhausted or frustrated.
</p>
<p>I think the real challenge for humans is not to compete with machines and robots, but to cooperate with machines and robots. If we find a way to live in peace with them, we can improve our living standards well. In addition, we don’t need to worry too much about whether automated machines will replace people’s jobs. What we need to do is to focus on our own work and strive to improve ourselves. If we do very well in the industry, no one, no machine can replace you. But the premise is that we should not always pay attention to repetitive and tedious work, we need to pay more attention to creative and meaningful work.
