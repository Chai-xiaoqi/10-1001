<div class="row1">
  <h4>Job uncertainty/higher unemployment rate </h4>
    <p>Automation has two offsetting effects on labour. The substitution effect causes the demand for labour to decrease as now technology is undertaking tasks that were previously performed by humans. This causes job uncertainty and increases the rate of uemployment especially for jobs involving physical or manual tasks, as they can be easily replaced by robots. As an example, the appearance of the Internet makes information searches more efficient but on the other hand it reduces the overall demand for librarians and other related jobs. A secondary data analysis 2017 Pew Research Center American Trends Panel surveying the American population found that individuals employed in jobs involving manual or physical tasks had more negative perceptions regarding the implact of technology on their careers.

<div class="row1">
  <h4>Lack of empathy with events</h4>
    <p> Automated technology can be a lack of empathy with events, they will only do the things that we tell it to. It does not have any emotions or empathy. Therefore, if the world is all over automated technology, society will become very cold, no emotions, no empathy, everything only for profit and this is not what we really want our society to be like.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="row1">
  <h4>Loss of human interactions</h4>
    <p>As there are losts of automated services such as online shopping etc, we are able to buy items without having any human contacts. Even though it is more efficient and convinence, we as a social being, need time spending with other people. 
    </p>
</div>

<div class="row1">
<h4>Create inequality</h4>
  <p>Some people will benefit significantly from automation such as software developers and others like labor workers will be struglle to find jobs or even struggle to gain equivalent employment. This would increase the gap between rich and poor and is not a nice thing to see.
